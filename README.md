# Horror art portfolio

For the Code Institute Bootcamp Hackathon #1, our team decided to complete the art portfolio project. We were inspired by the works of H.R.Giger and Zdzyslaw Beksinski and their particular brands of surrealist horror. By combining their styles, we created a fake artist named Z.D.Gigerowski. This static webpage made with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap is his portfolio.

## Features 




### User stories

- __Sitewide__

  - As a visitor, I want the portfolio website to be mobile-responsive, so that I can view and explore artworks on my smartphone or tablet device.

  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/gallery%20screen%20shot%20mobile.png)
  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/contact%20page%20screen%20shot%20mobile.png)

&#10003; Three hero images on the home page showcase a blurred version of the latest works in the artists three main styles. Each hero image also contains a brief description of the specific style and a call to action to explore that style further in the gallery.

&#10003; Home page scrolls through hero images cleanly

- __Navigation__

  - As a user, I want an attractive and simple navigation bar on every page so that I can easily navigate through the website.

  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/nav%20bar%20desktop.png)

&#10003; Navigation bar is simple and functional on desktop

  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/nav%20bar%20mobile%20drop%20down.png)

&#10003; Navigation on mobile is a toggled drop down button

&#10003; Text borders change color on mobile to provide more contrast for accessibility.

- __Contact__
 
  - As a user, I want to be able to contact the artist directly through the portfolio website (e.g., via a contact form or email), so that I can inquire about purchasing artwork or commissioning a custom piece.

  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/home%20page%20screen%20shot%20mobile%203.png)
  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/contact%20page%20desktop.png)

&#10003; Call to action on the home page that redirects to the contact page with a contact form to get in touch.

  - As a user, I want to chat to the artist directly through a chat window in order to ask questions in real time.

      &#10023; Not feasible 

- __Gallery__

  - As a user, I want access to a gallery of the artist's work so that I can view it easily.

  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/Gallery%20on%20Desktop.png)
  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/gallery%20screen%20shot%20mobile.png)

&#10003; Fully responsive page

  - As a user, I want access to high resolution versions of the art work so that I can properly view the artist's art.
  - As a user, I want the high quality images to open in a new tab so that I can keep exploring the main website from where I was.

  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/gallery%20card.png)

&#10003; Note the link which will open into a new tab with a high resolution version of the image

  - As a user, I want to see the titles and quick info of each piece of artwork as I hover over them so that I can learn more about them quickly.

      &#10003; Titles as seen on the card above, optional descriptor text to be added

- __About__

  - As a user, I want to see pictures of the artist so that I can get to know them more.
  - As the artist I want pictures of myself shown to the user so that I can present myself well.
  - As a user, I want to see the artist's biography so that I can learn more about them.

  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/about%20page%20desktop.png)
  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/about%20page%20screen%20shot%20mobile.png)

&#10003; Wireframe in MoSCoW followed precicely

  - As a user, I want to see a timeline of the artist's work/life so that I can quickly learn about their journey as an artist.

      &#10003; Detailed biography sections made a timeline unnecessary

- __Merchandise__

  - As a user, I want the ability to purchase some art directly from the website so that I can easily support the artist.

  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/home%20page%20call%20to%20action.png)

&#10003; All products are commisioned pieces so contacting the artist is the best way to make a purchase

- __Footer__

  - As a user, I want to see clickable social links in the footer so that I can easily go to the artist's socials to keep up to date with them.
  - As the artist, I want to have clickable social links in the footer of the website so that I can increase traffic to them.
  - As the artist, I want my copyrights to be visible in the footer so that I can protect my IP.
  - As a user, I want back to top button on the footer so that I can return to the top of the page with only 1 click.

  ![image info](assets/userstoryimages/footer.png)

&#10003; Footer covers all the above user stories, all footer links and buttons change color on float for accesibility

  - As a user, I want to see contact information in the footer so that I can easily contact the artist.

      &#10023; The artist prefers to screen requests and has asked not to have contact information readily available but instead wants to encourage the use of the contact form page

  - As a user, I want to see a contact link in the footer so that I can easily contact the artist.

      &#10023; All nav links were removed from the footer as the nav bar would remain fixed in the viewport. This lead to a far cleaner look.
