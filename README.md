# Horror art portfolio

For the Code Institute Bootcamp Hackathon #1, our team decided to complete the art portfolio project. We were inspired by the works of H.R.Giger and Zdzyslaw Beksinski and their particular brands of surrealist horror. By combining their styles, we created a fake artist named Z.D.Gigerowski. This static webpage made with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap is his portfolio.
